### Git contribution Details
Direct Contribution onto the **main** branch is **not** allowed.

Please write your own Documentation into the correct Folder following our naming convention and leave a PR (Pull Request) for other people to review your additions and add them into the **collaboration files**.

---
#### Collab Files
*Example* : [[Topic]] 

> Should only be edited by the **PR Reviewer**!

Includes a reduced and refined format of gathered information. Merged from the documents of multiple people!

#### Personal Files
*Example* : [[Topic - NAME]] 

> Your personal Documentation / Summary of the Topic

#### Merging process
Steps :
1. Create a new Branch for the Lecture
2. Write your own Documentation for the Lecture
3. Create [**PR** (Pull Request)](https://docs.github.com/de/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and start the review process
4. The Reviewer looks over your Document and includes everything new into the dedicated **Collab File**
5. Checkout the Main Branch again as a new starting point!


Consider to use `git pull` regularly to keep your local repo up to date!
