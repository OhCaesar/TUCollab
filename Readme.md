### This is our **TU *Collaboration* Vault**.

---

> This Obsidian Vault should include *course Documents* as well as *transcripts* for each lecture.

The Idea behind this Project is to create a shared knowledgebase to exract the most important infos in and around our Courses. The Experience should enhance our collaborative skills and create a better understanding for good and readable Documentation.

Please read through our instruction documents to learn about our way of working as well as our [[Contribution Guidelines]]

> These Guidelines will be enforced over Configuration Management and are therefore not a convenience tool but rather strictly applied as our standard way of working.

If you do not have any experience writing in **Markdown** Syntax, using **Obsidian** or **collaborative Git** please consider reading through the official Documentation first.
